## WHAT IS PTA?

PTA (Parent Teacher Association) is the largest volunteer child advocacy association in the nation. It works on behalf of itâ€™s members to unite parents, teachers, and the community for the common good of ALL children.Â Â 

Creston PTA is a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit association so your donations are tax deductible.

## OUR MISSION

**To engage and empower families in our community to support and advocate for our students so that they can reach their full potential.** We aim to holistically enhance every student's school experience with family-friendly and culturally-relevant events. We are dedicated to collaborating with the school to promote student health, well-being and educational success through strong parent, family and community involvement. 

## Family Engagement

Research shows that **children whose parents and families are engaged in and hold high expectations of their education tend to earn better grades, have higher graduations rates, and are more likely to enroll in post-secondary education.**

Creston PTA is committed to engaging parents in meaningful ways, so that families can actively support their childrenâ€™s and adolescent's learning and development.
