Mary Beth is in her second year as a Creston parent. She and her family enjoy camping in the warmer months and building couch cushion forts in the colder months. By day, she works fulltime in development/fundraising and at night she’s trying out new recipes and watching reruns of West Wing.

This is my fourth year on the Creston PTA Board and I have a fifth grader. I work at the Portland Art Museum during the day and enjoy playing ultimate frisbee, camping, reading, riding my bike, and coffee. I enjoy being involved with the PTA because I like to be informed about our school, the district, and doing what I can to make our school the best it can be. I’ve also met some wonderful people who are working so hard for our kids! 

### **Volunteer & Membership Chair**

I joined the PTA Board as the Volunteer & Membership Coordinator in 2021. I have a fourth grader and a second grader. I love to travel, listen to music, try new foods, and exercise (hiking, biking, yoga). I got involved with the PTA because I wanted to build community with other families in the neighborhood, use my skills to help with school programs, encourage volunteerism, and learn more about what was happening at the school.

### **Health & Safety Chair**

**Josh Roll, healthandsafety@crestonschoolpta.org**

This is my second year on the PTA Board as the Health & Safety Chair. I have a second grader and a kindergartener. I enjoy gardening and canning, coach baseball and rugby and loved watching the US men and women's rugby teams get after it at the Olympics this summer. There is so much in the world where we are all but powerless to do all that much about but organizing around our public school, a hearth of the larger community, allows for a place where the benefits of direct action can be seen and felt almost immediately. Putting in the time now ensures our kids have the supports they need and can make up for some of the financial resources that are not available.

### **DEI Chair**

**VACANT,** We're actively recruiting for this role so please join us at any point during the school year. Contact Jenna to get involved: president@crestonschoolpta.org
