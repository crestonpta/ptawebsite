This is my second year at Creston with a 1st grader in tow, and I'm humbled to serve on the PTA board.  I'm a local business owner and have lived in the PNW for all my life. I love to garden, run, and spend time with my amazing family and doggo.  Our board is filled with passionate members that value Public Education for all.  We welcome any and all who want to support and volunteer as we know that a strong foundation starts with parental involvement.

This is my second year as a Creston parent with a rad first grader. I love spending time with my family crafting, playing board games and snuggling our new dog Plum. I’m an artist and was excited to get to draw the eagles on our spirit wear this year! Creston truly is a special little school and I value contributing to what the PTA adds to the kids’ experiences.

This is my fourth year on the Creston PTA Board and I have a fifth grader. I work at the Portland Art Museum during the day and enjoy playing ultimate frisbee, camping, reading, riding my bike, and coffee. I enjoy being involved with the PTA because I like to be informed about our school, the district, and doing what I can to make our school the best it can be. I’ve also met some wonderful people who are working so hard for our kids! 

### **Volunteer & Membership Chair**

I have two children at Creston (Emmett's in 1st grade and Wyatt's in 3rd grade) and love being part of the community. I joined the PTA to help others find ways to get involved in school activities this year and to strengthen peoples' feelings of connection to our neighborhood school. I'm a former teacher, but for the past decade, I've managed a health policy office at the Oregon Health Authority. During spare time, I coach womens' rugby, love to read, and enjoy watching our kids play sports!

### **Health & Safety Chair**

This is my third year on the PTA Board as the Health & Safety Chair. I have a  third grader and a first  grader. I enjoy gardening and canning, coach baseball and rugby and loved watching the US men and women's rugby teams get after it at the Olympics this summer. There is so much in the world where we are all but powerless to do all that much about but organizing around our public school, a hearth of the larger community, allows for a place where the benefits of direct action can be seen and felt almost immediately. Putting in the time now ensures our kids have the supports they need and can make up for some of the financial resources that are not available. 

### **DEI Chair**

**VACANT,** We're actively recruiting for this role so please join us at any point during the school year. Contact president@crestonschoolpta.org with interest.
