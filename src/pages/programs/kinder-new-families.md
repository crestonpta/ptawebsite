## WHAT IS KINDER CONNECT?

**C﻿onnect to Kindergarten info nights for the 26-27 school year:**\
**Thursday, February 12 @ 5 pm** \
**Thursday, April 9 @ 5 pm**

### School Tours with the Principal

We also offer school tours with the principal on the **second Thursday of each month**, with two options to fit your schedule. Upcoming tour dates are:

* **February 12**
* **March 12**
* **April 9**
* **May 14**
* **June 11**

For each date, families may choose one of the following times:

* **Morning Tour at 9:30 AM**\
  This tour allows families to see Creston in action during the school day—classrooms, transitions, and learning in real time.
* **Evening Tour at 5:30 PM**\
  This option includes a guided tour of the building along with a more detailed question-and-answer session.

The more you learn, the more confident you and your child will feel on the first day of school! Information on upcoming Kindergarten Connect events and a video from Principal Langdahl may be found on the [Creston School Website](https://www.pps.net/domain/6407).
