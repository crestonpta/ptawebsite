## WHAT IS CCMA?

Creston Community Mutual Aid (CCMA) is a volunteer-led organization formed in 2021 to support the needs of families within the Creston school community. Our hope is for a more equitable, sustainable, and connected community. We believe this starts with everyone being able to meet their basic needs.

## CCMA vs. PTA

A key difference between CCMA and Creston PTA is how we distribute funds. Creston PTA uses funds to support the school and student body as a whole and, therefore, can’t distribute funds to individual families. Donations to CCMA are directly distributed to families who need help with expenses like rent, utilities, and childcare.

***During 2022-2023, CCMA distributed nearly $10,000 in direct financial assistance to Creston families!***
