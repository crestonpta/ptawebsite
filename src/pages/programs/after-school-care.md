Champions offers before and after school care as well as summer and school break programs. Our K-6 curriculum is based on the latest educational research. It uses choice and play based activities to focus on building the three critical abilities that have the most impact on a childâ€™s future success:

* Social-emotional skills
* Executive-function skills
* Inquiry-based learning
