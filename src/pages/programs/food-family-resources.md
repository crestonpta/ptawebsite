Urban Gleaners offers our community free groceries every **Tuesday at 1:30pm** at the front of the school to help with food insecurity and reduce food waste. Food is offered to all community members regardless of income.

Reminders and cancellations are emailed weekly via Givebacks. You can find more distribution locations on the Urban Gleaners website.
